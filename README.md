## General Information
The Lending Club case study aims to analyze loan default patterns, identify factors influencing default, and identify customer and loan attributes to reduce defaults in future loan grants.

## Conclusions
Default Risk Factors in Loans

* Loans with less than 36 months tenure are more likely to default due to high monthly EMI.
* Customers who have rented or mortgaged their homes also tend to default.
* Customers with annual income less than 50k are more likely to default.
* Verified customers default more often than non-verified ones, suggesting potential lapses or corruption in verification processes.
* Customers who consolidate multiple loans often default heavily, indicating the need for cautious lending practices.

## Technologies Used
* Python 3(ipykernel)
* Jupiter notebook version 7.0.8
* Microsoft Power point for Presentation
